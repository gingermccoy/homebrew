# homebrew-pstoedit

I managed to get all of this to work. Your milage may vary. This installs a slightly tweaked version of the Unix command line application pstoedit. The app has been modified to output g-code that is appropriate for my pen plotter.

It is designed to be installed through the Brew package management framework.
